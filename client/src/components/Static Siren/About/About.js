            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>After the release of Cryptic Calling's debut album, James hit a severe bout of writer's block.
                While sifting through long forgotten demos, James decided to start a seperate musical project apart
                from Cryptic Calling.  James wanted to experiment a little more, and the result was Static Siren.  
                Pulling influence from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka as well as utilizing odd time signatures,
                distorted bass, and no electric guitars, Static Siren stands apart from Cryptic Calling while still
                maintaining James's rock roots.
