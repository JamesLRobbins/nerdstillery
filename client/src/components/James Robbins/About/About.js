            <p>
                With 2 musical projects under his belt, what purpose does James have for another?
                While writing music for the Static Siren project, James began to notice that he still
                had an abundance of left-over songs that didn't quite fit with either Cryptic Calling
                or Static Siren.  Instead of trying to force them and make them work, he decided to just 
                start another project.  After working on both Cryptic Calling and Static Siren, James began
                to realize that he prefers to just write music, not necessarily write for a specific project.
                So Just James will include songs that didn't quite fit the other 2 projects.
