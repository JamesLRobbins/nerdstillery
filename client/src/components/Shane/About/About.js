            <p>As the official photographer for Nerdstillery, Shane attended school at Nossi College of Art in Nashville.  
                After his grandfather gifted him an old Kodak Brownie Hawkeye camera, Shane developed a love for vintage cameras which eventually turned 
                into a passion for photography.  With an active interest in cosplay, one of Shaneâ€™s biggest influences is Martin Wong Photography.  
                Which he states is what motivates him to continue to develop his craft</p>

                <p>Aside from cosplay, Shane enjoys being a diverse photography and has built up an impressive portfolio that includes boudoir, 
                    maternity, family, etc.  Over the years, Shane has had his work published in 2 small magazines, and also enjoys being the Head 
                    Photographer for the Middle Tennessee Anime Convention (MTAC).  Please feel free to reach out for more information and session rate.</p>

                    <p>When not working photography, Shane enjoys drawing and play survival horror video games.</p>
