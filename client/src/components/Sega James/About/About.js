            <p>
                 What happens when a youtube star wannabe and a Sega Genesis decide to start a band?
                 Well the end result is Sega James.  After having a hard time finding a band, Sega 
                 decided that no other console could rock as hard as he could.  With James on guitar
                 and vocals, Sega handles the rest.  However, things don't always seem to work out well
                 for James in the end.  But you can tell that he cherishes his friendship with Sega.
