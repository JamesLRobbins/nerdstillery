            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Officially launced in 2011, drummer Shea Shankle and singer/guitarist
            James Robbins met while attending school for audio engineering.  After working on a school project
            together, the two started jamming together to some original songs that James had lying around.  They
            played their first show together with James on vocals and acoustic guitar, and Shea on Djembe and backing
            vocals.  Eventually the two released their first E.P. and started playing shows.  Not too long after,
            Clay Zimmerman joined to fill in for bass.  The three piece band shows around the Nashville area,
            including opening for Saliva.  Unfortunately each member eventually went their seperate ways, with Shea starting
            a new project with other local musicians called Sons of our Fathers.</p>

            <p>
                Afterwards, James decided to continue with the project, which resulted in the release of Cryptic Calling's
                debut album "Last Words" which was released in 2016.  After the release of the album, James started work
                on a seperate musical project with the intention to bring Cryptic Calling back, and possibly venture into
                heavier musical territory.
