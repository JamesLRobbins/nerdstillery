          <h2>"Disavowed"</h2>
          <p />
          You can't run away from the world <br />
          That you created to hide the shame <br />
          Of all that you couldn't be <br />
          And now you see what you've done <br />
          You can't hide the fact that <br />
          Every single word that you say <br />
          Is just another lie <br />
          <br />
          One day you'll see that life is no fantasy <br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)<br />
          How can I ever forget<br />
          The day you'll one day regret<br />
          When you decided there was no longer a use for me<br />
          And now the tables turned<br />
          When will you ever learn<br />
          There's no denying that I never really needed you<br />
          <br />
          Was I just a pawn in your twisted game<br />
          I never thought I'd be so blind<br />
          The trust that you betrayed<br />
          You can't deny who you are<br />
          Does it hurt to know <br />
          I'm every little thing in this world<br />
          That you've desired<br />
          <br />
          One day you'll see that life is no fantasy<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)<br />
          <br />
          You said that you were my friend<br />
          I won't let you use me again<br />
          I won't let you use me again<br />
          <br />

          <h2>"Failure to Resist"</h2>
          <br />
          Well I know the fear of letting go<br />
          Its harder than you know<br />
          We've been through this before<br />
          I just can't take it anymore<br />
          And now the secrets out<br />
          How did this come about<br />
          You dare to tell me that your better off without<br />
          You looked me in the eyes<br />
          To softly say goodbye<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)
          <br />
          And I can't believe<br />
          Why would you just turn your back on me<br />
          You said this love would never die<br />
          But now you say goodbye<br />
          <br />
          And were you just afraid<br />
          Of the promise that we made<br />
          It's hard to understand<br />
          How this got so out of hand<br />
          And if you only knew<br />
          Just what you put me through<br />
          I never thought that you could be so damn untrue<br />
          You threw this love awry<br />
          And now I ask you why<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)
          <br />
          I never thought it would end like this<br />
          A simple matter of a failure to resist<br />
          How can you live with yourself<br />
          No regrets, no shame<br />
          Another pawn in this game you play<br />
          So go away<br />
          <br />

          <h2>"Never Say Goodbye"</h2>
          <br />
          For so long I've dreamed<br />
          Hoped my wish would become my reality<br />
          You were the answer to my prayers<br />
          But sometimes I can't believe that your truly there<br />
          <br />
          So close your eyes<br />
          And say goodnight<br />
          I know that tomorrow will be all right<br />
          And in my heart<br />
          You're love resides<br />
          I promise I will never leave your side<br />

          So much left unsaid<br />
          Its all right<br />
          Just try and rest your weary head<br />
          Its too much to comprehend<br />
          But I know that these feelings will never end<br />
          <br />
          So close your eyes<br />
          And say goodnight<br />
          I pray that tomorrow will be all right<br />
          And in my heart<br />
          You're love resides<br />
          I swore that I would never leave your side<br />
          <br />
          She tries her hardest to disguise<br />
          The sad look in her eyes<br />
          I'll welcome with embrace<br />
          God please let me take her place<br />
          <br />
          So close your eyes<br />
          And say goodnight<br />
          I swear that time will someday make it right<br />
          And when my heart<br />
          No longer tries<br />
          I know I'll once again be by your side<br />
          <br />
          I will wait for that day<br />
          I'll think about you everyday<br />
          Though my world<br />
          Has been torn apart<br />
          Your love still lingers in my heart

          <br />
          You could never find the words to say<br />
          To make us all understand why you left that day<br />
          I hope it hurts to know that we<br />
          Never needed you from the start<br />
          We reassembled the pieces that you tore apart<br />
          And all the lies that we believed<br />
          You said you'd never leave<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)<br />
          So tell me why you failed to try<br />
          We never believed you would say goodbye<br />
          The day you left with no regrets<br />
          You left us alone here<br />
          The day we'll never forget<br />

          When you were making the choice to depart<br />
          Did you consider the adverse effects<br />
          Of a broken heart<br />
          You sealed your fate alone<br />
          Were you<br />
          Ever concerned if we'd survive<br />
          When you had made the decision<br />
          That changed our lives<br />
          And did we ever cross your mind<br />
          The ones you left behind<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)<br />
          <br />

          I close my eyes and look away<br />
          This life you've slowly brought to shame<br />
          With no regrets you chose to lie<br />
          And hurt the ones who only tried<br />
          To show you love and keep you alive<br />
          And still you chose to chase your high<br />
          I won't be there when nothing remains<br />
          I've watched your life go down the drain<br />
          <br />
          And when you couldn't face the truth<br />
          You lied and said you'd make it through<br />
          The wasted tears of those who cried<br />
          And only tried<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)
          <br />
          So walk away<br />
          Don't say goodbye<br />
          Just leave this life behind<br />
          I know you'll miss it all one day<br />
          And on that day<br />
          I'll walk away<br />
          <br />
          These empty streets you walk alone<br />
          Forced to make it on your own<br />
          No ones there<br />
          You suffer the loss<br />
          This path in life comes at a cost<br />
          Have you no shame for the pain that you gave<br />
          To the ones that still hope to save<br />
          Your life from this ill-fated path that you chose<br />
          And this life that you slowly dispose<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)
          <br />
          Don't dare to try<br />
          To make me change my mind<br />
          You gave it all away on that day<br />
          On that day you walked away<br />
          <br />
          There is no time<br />
          Just swallow your pride<br />
          And face the tears of those who cried<br />
          And only tried<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)
          <br />
          Don't dare to try<br />
          To make me change my mind<br />

          <br />
          Sitting by the window<br />
          Waiting for you to come back home<br />
          I'm lost without you<br />
          How could you leave me here alone<br />
          You were my hero<br />
          You picked me up when I was down<br />
          Gone forever<br />
          You promised you'd always be around<br />
          <br />
          But where did you go<br />
          <br />
          Startled by the screaming<br />

          How could you leave me<br />
          You said I'd be better off with you gone<br />
          You were my hero<br />
          But now I don't know what I believe<br />
          You said I'm sorry<br />
          Whatever you do don't follow me<br />
          <br />

          Forever to make it on my own<br />

          But still I prayed<br />

          Here I am sitting here<br />
          As the world around me disappears<br />
          All I see is your face<br />
          You meant so much to me<br />
          And even though I know you're free<br />
          I can't bare that you are gone<br />
          Am I dreaming<br />
          I'm so scared<br />
          That I'll never wake from this nightmare<br />
          Why is life so unfair<br />
          I'll move on and stay strong<br />
          Tell everyone that nothings wrong<br />
          But I can't hold back all these tears<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)<br />
          Your presense still lingers on<br />
          In memories where they belong<br />
          In photographs of better times<br />
          And forever in my mother's eyes<br />
          Its been so hard since you've been gone<br />
          I can't believe its been this long<br />
          So on I wait I don't to stay awake<br />
          <br />
          (Chorus)<br />
          When you said you loved me<br />
          <br />
          Those words still echo in my head<br />
          Forever 'till the very end
